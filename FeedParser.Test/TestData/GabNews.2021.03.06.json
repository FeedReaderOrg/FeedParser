In the simplest terms transhumanists believe in using technology to transcend beyond the limitations of human biology into a post-human existence. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is something we are all familiar with on a surface level thanks to many different movies and TV shows over the years, but it&#8217;s time to start taking it seriously as a threat to humanity itself. </p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-2725\"></span>\n\n\n\n<p>The march towards transhumanism isn&#8217;t a conspiracy theory or some outlandish science fiction movie, it&#8217;s a very real and dire situation unfolding before our eyes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The oligarchs in the American regime, in particular the ones in Silicon Valley, are obsessed with eternal life and the topic of transhumanism. Peter Thiel wants <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/08/peter-thiel-wants-to-inject-himself-with-young-peoples-blood\" target=\"_blank\">to inject himself with young people&#8217;s blood</a> as a method of &#8220;radical life extension.&#8221; Elon Musk <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53956683\" target=\"_blank\">put a computer chip in a pig&#8217;s brain</a> with the hopes of one day soon putting one in yours. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Facebook <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/8/5/20750259/facebook-ai-mind-reading-brain-computer-interface\" target=\"_blank\">is working on &#8220;brain tech&#8221;</a> that can read your mind. Google&#8217;s Ray Kurzweil&nbsp;is <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/22/robots-google-ray-kurzweil-terminator-singularity-artificial-intelligence\" target=\"_blank\">obsessed with progressing towards the &#8220;singularity,&#8221;</a> a moment where artificial intelligence overtakes human thinking, on his quest to become &#8220;immortal.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Crypto is a tool. Transhumanism is the goal.</p>&mdash; balajis.com (@balajis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1365658078796861443?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 27, 2021</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal of the Silicon Valley oligarchs, and of the globalists in general, is transhumanism. They aren&#8217;t hiding this, in fact they are flaunting it in front of our faces. While we are all too busy bickering about what AOC tweeted this week, the oligarchs are spending billions of dollars to become immoral &#8220;gods.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their strategy is two-fold. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, they perfect the transhumanist technology behind closed doors and become among the first human beings to &#8220;transcend&#8221; beyond the limitations of human biology to become &#8220;gods&#8221; with eternal life and access to all of the knowledge and information available in the cloud. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, they will get the rest of us to adopt a form of this technology that they own and control by selling us on &#8220;progress&#8221; and convenience. If you doubt they will be successful with this approach, just look at the phone in the palm of your hand as a wildly successful beta test of this strategy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In many ways the smartphone was the first iteration of this grand vision. We are now witnessing the consequences of giving them the power to control the flow of information and access to basic online services in the form of censorship, deplatforming, and outright unpersoning of individuals, businesses, and any threat to their system of control. What do you think will happen when they build, own, and control the chip they plant in your brain at birth? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to fully understand this you need to understand the mindset of the Silicon Valley elite and the American Oligarch Regime. These people believe that they are superior to the rest of us in every way. They went to the &#8220;best&#8221; schools. They built the &#8220;best&#8221; companies. They consolidated all of the wealth into their hands. They know what is &#8220;best.&#8221; This is why they project their supremacy on the rest of us with terms like &#8220;white supremacist.&#8221; We are but mere cattle to them. Digital serfs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This may all sound outlandish now, but this technology is being developed as we speak and it is something that people under 50 will witness in their lifetime. We need to be prepared to fight for our humanity and to resist the literal dehumanization of the entire human race itself. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, this is a spiritual war. They are targeting our very humanity. This is evidenced by everything that these people promote. Their &#8220;values&#8221; are inherently anti-human. Abortion. Moral decay. The destruction of sovereign nations and people. The persecution of everything and anything related to God Almighty our Creator. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need to prepare ourselves for what is coming by exiting their entire system and raising up our children to value and cherish human life.

In the simplest terms transhumanists believe in using technology to transcend beyond the limitations of human biology into a post-human existence. \n\n\n\nThis is something we are all familiar with on a surface level thanks to many different movies and TV shows over the years, but it&#8217;s time to start taking it seriously as a threat to humanity itself. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe march towards transhumanism isn&#8217;t a conspiracy theory or some outlandish science fiction movie, it&#8217;s a very real and dire situation unfolding before our eyes. \n\n\n\nThe oligarchs in the American regime, in particular the ones in Silicon Valley, are obsessed with eternal life and the topic of transhumanism. Peter Thiel wants to inject himself with young people&#8217;s blood as a method of &#8220;radical life extension.&#8221; Elon Musk put a computer chip in a pig&#8217;s brain with the hopes of one day soon putting one in yours. \n\n\n\nFacebook is working on &#8220;brain tech&#8221; that can read your mind. Google&#8217;s Ray Kurzweil&nbsp;is obsessed with progressing towards the &#8220;singularity,&#8221; a moment where artificial intelligence overtakes human thinking, on his quest to become &#8220;immortal.&#8221; \n\n\n\n\nCrypto is a tool. Transhumanism is the goal.&mdash; balajis.com (@balajis) February 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\nThe goal of the Silicon Valley oligarchs, and of the globalists in general, is transhumanism. They aren&#8217;t hiding this, in fact they are flaunting it in front of our faces. While we are all too busy bickering about what AOC tweeted this week, the oligarchs are spending billions of dollars to become immoral &#8220;gods.&#8221; \n\n\n\nTheir strategy is two-fold. \n\n\n\nFirst, they perfect the transhumanist technology behind closed doors and become among the first human beings to &#8220;transcend&#8221; beyond the limitations of human biology to become &#8220;gods&#8221; with eternal life and access to all of the knowledge and information available in the cloud. \n\n\n\nSecond, they will get the rest of us to adopt a form of this technology that they own and control by selling us on &#8220;progress&#8221; and convenience. If you doubt they will be successful with this approach, just look at the phone in the palm of your hand as a wildly successful beta test of this strategy. \n\n\n\nIn many ways the smartphone was the first iteration of this grand vision. We are now witnessing the consequences of giving them the power to control the flow of information and access to basic online services in the form of censorship, deplatforming, and outright unpersoning of individuals, businesses, and any threat to their system of control. What do you think will happen when they build, own, and control the chip they plant in your brain at birth? \n\n\n\nIn order to fully understand this you need to understand the mindset of the Silicon Valley elite and the American Oligarch Regime. These people believe that they are superior to the rest of us in every way. They went to the &#8220;best&#8221; schools. They built the &#8220;best&#8221; companies. They consolidated all of the wealth into their hands. They know what is &#8220;best.&#8221; This is why they project their supremacy on the rest of us with terms like &#8220;white supremacist.&#8221; We are but mere cattle to them. Digital serfs. \n\n\n\nThis may all sound outlandish now, but this technology is being developed as we speak and it is something that people under 50 will witness in their lifetime. We need to be prepared to fight for our humanity and to resist the literal dehumanization of the entire human race itself. \n\n\n\nUltimately, this is a spiritual war. They are targeting our very humanity. This is evidenced by everything that these people promote. Their &#8220;values&#8221; are inherently anti-human. Abortion. Moral decay. The destruction of sovereign nations and people. The persecution of everything and anything related to God Almighty our Creator. \n\n\n\nWe need to prepare ourselves for what is coming by exiting their entire system and raising up our children to value and cherish human life. We need to build our own economy. We need to return to tradition and get right with God right now, because the judgement day of singularity is upon us. \n\n\n\nAndrew TorbaCEO, Gab.comFebruary 27th, 2021Jesus is King",

We&#8217;ve been deplatformed by 25+ service providers including both app stores, PayPal, dozens of payment processors, hosting providers, email services, and more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When this happens I rejoice and praise God because I know that He is working to separate the wheat from the chaff. This deplatforming inevitably reforms Gab into an even more resilient community, business, and platform. We don&#8217;t just sit around and whine when these things happen, we immediately get to work. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We aren&#8217;t victims, we are builders. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://gab.com/DustinWBenge/posts/105656014224523369\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"936\" height=\"414\" src=\"https://news.gab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-01-at-3.21.41-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2671\" srcset=\"https://news.gab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-01-at-3.21.41-PM.png 936w, https://news.gab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-01-at-3.21.41-PM-300x133.png 300w, https://news.gab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-01-at-3.21.41-PM-768x340.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Personally I don\u2019t believe the common Christian mantra to \u201cbe in the world, but not of the world\u201d means giving the enemy our money, time, and data.This has got to stop, right now. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>John 15:19</em></strong><em><br>If you were of the world, the world would love its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, because of this the world hates you.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am in the process of transitioning every part of my financial expenses to support Christian businesses, Christian media companies, Christian content creators, and Christian people. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am done giving my money to The Enemy and funding the destruction of our country and values. I encourage everyone else to do the same. If they are not serving God, they are serving Satan and I&#8217;m simply not going to fund that activity. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deeply examine the businesses, brands, and media companies you currently support both financially and with your time. If they are virtue signaling critical theory nonsense or owned by demons you should immediately stop paying them and using their services. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"960\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://news.gab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/download-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2675\" srcset=\"https://news.gab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/download-1.jpg 960w, https://news.gab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/download-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://news.gab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/download-1-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point we have no choice but to &#8220;build our own&#8221; everything. That starts by supporting those who are already building and share our values. It&#8217;s not about simply building our own social networking platforms anymore, it&#8217;s about building our own Christian economy. One without cancel culture. One that doesn&#8217;t embrace the demonic and degenerate cult religion of critical theory. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Critical theory (cultural marxism, the cult of social justice, etc) is a fraudulent, vapid, and pathetic subversion of well-meaning Christians, churches, and Christian values in general.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It lures decent God-fearing people into practicing a false and demonic pseudo-religion designed to accelerate their spiritual and literal demise. It preys on the malleable minds of our youth. It enslaves those who practice it and seeks to destroy those who do not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a demonic imitation gospel and most certainly not the Gospel of Jesus Christ. It must be mocked, shunned, and rebuked by all Christians. Now is not the time to sleepwalk through history on this subject. We must know the enemy\u2019s fake gospel better than they know it themselves so we can lead others away from it and towards to the Gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talk to your kids about these things. Homeschool them if at all possible. Cut the cable cord. Delete the Big Tech apps from their phones and your own.

            "content_text": "Over the course of the past week Gab has been deplatformed by one of our banks, a business we were working with to source new server hardware, third-party infrastructure analysis software, and even our accountant. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis isn&#8217;t anything new for us. We&#8217;ve been deplatformed by 25+ service providers including both app stores, PayPal, dozens of payment processors, hosting providers, email services, and more. \n\n\n\nWhen this happens I rejoice and praise God because I know that He is working to separate the wheat from the chaff. This deplatforming inevitably reforms Gab into an even more resilient community, business, and platform. We don&#8217;t just sit around and whine when these things happen, we immediately get to work. \n\n\n\nWe aren&#8217;t victims, we are builders. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonally I don\u2019t believe the common Christian mantra to \u201cbe in the world, but not of the world\u201d means giving the enemy our money, time, and data.This has got to stop, right now. \n\n\n\nJohn 15:19If you were of the world, the world would love its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, because of this the world hates you.\n\n\n\nI am in the process of transitioning every part of my financial expenses to support Christian businesses, Christian media companies, Christian content creators, and Christian people. \n\n\n\nI am done giving my money to The Enemy and funding the destruction of our country and values. I encourage everyone else to do the same. If they are not serving God, they are serving Satan and I&#8217;m simply not going to fund that activity. \n\n\n\nDeeply examine the businesses, brands, and media companies you currently support both financially and with your time. If they are virtue signaling critical theory nonsense or owned by demons you should immediately stop paying them and using their services. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point we have no choice but to &#8220;build our own&#8221; everything. That starts by supporting those who are already building and share our values. It&#8217;s not about simply building our own social networking platforms anymore, it&#8217;s about building our own Christian economy. One without cancel culture. One that doesn&#8217;t embrace the demonic and degenerate cult religion of critical theory. \n\n\n\nCritical theory (cultural marxism, the cult of social justice, etc) is a fraudulent, vapid, and pathetic subversion of well-meaning Christians, churches, and Christian values in general.\n\n\n\nIt lures decent God-fearing people into practicing a false and demonic pseudo-religion designed to accelerate their spiritual and literal demise. It preys on the malleable minds of our youth. It enslaves those who practice it and seeks to destroy those who do not.\n\n\n\nIt is a demonic imitation gospel and most certainly not the Gospel of Jesus Christ. It must be mocked, shunned, and rebuked by all Christians. Now is not the time to sleepwalk through history on this subject. We must know the enemy\u2019s fake gospel better than they know it themselves so we can lead others away from it and towards to the Gospel of Jesus Christ.\n\n\n\nTalk to your kids about these things. Homeschool them if at all possible. Cut the cable cord. Delete the Big Tech apps from their phones and your own. We have a lot of work to do, but remember that we have the Creator of the Universe on our side. Through Him all things are possible.\n\n\n\nI was talking about some of these things with a friend this morning and she used a term that made a lot of sense to me: &#8220;the silent secession.&#8221; At the moment this secession is largely digital and economic, not geographical, but perhaps that will change at some point in the future.

As many of you will know, Riverside and Old Forge have the biggest rivalry in high school football spanning back decades so with that said: GO VIKES!<br><br>I know many of you voted for Joe Biden, including members of my own family, and that&#8217;s okay. In my humble opinion Joe Biden is someone who left our area at a very young age and only ever seems to come back when it&#8217;s time to fundraise. </p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-2662\"></span>\n\n\n\n<p>I voted for Donald J. Trump, twice. I&#8217;m not going to apologize for that just as I wouldn&#8217;t expect you to do so for voting Biden. We are all a lot more a like than those in power would have use believe. We share the same struggles and have the same goals of providing for and protecting our families. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also share common enemies: the oligarchic elites in Central Banking, Wall St, Big Tech, Big Pharma, Big Education, the Legacy Media, and more. These people in power seek to pit us against one another as they get richer and the rest of us struggle to feed our families. They use the Legacy Media, Hollywood, and Big Tech to accomplish this. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>My vision is for us to unite together to take our country back from these wicked people in power. To do so we will need to escape from their digital mind prisons that track, censor, and monetize our data. We will need to step outside the illusory two party system and realize that the Uniparty is not serving the best interests of The People. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those of you who know me know that I come from humble roots.
